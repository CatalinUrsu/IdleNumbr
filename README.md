# IdleNumber

In many idle games, players accumulate resources or points that can grow to extraordinarily large numbers.
To ensure readability and ease of comprehension, these numbers are frequently represented using an
abbreviation system. This implementation provides a clean, organized way to display and manipulate such
large numbers within the game environment.

This implementation has several features:

- **Abbreviated Notation:**
    - Convert large numbers into a more digestible format (e.g., 1,000,000 becomes 1M).
  <br>Numbers are converted using commonly understood prefixes like K (Thousand), M (Million), B (Billion), and so on, up to Q (Quintillion). 
  <br>Beyond that, the system continues using alphabetical sequences such as AA, AB, AC, etc., to represent exponentially larger values.

- **Decimal Precision:**
    - Maintain precision in large numbers by including decimal points. Allow for a fixed or dynamic number of decimal places for better accuracy without overly complex or long numbers (e.g., 123.45M).

- **Conversion Algorithm:**
    - **Logic:** Sequentially divide and categorize numbers by their magnitude, assigning the appropriate abbreviation.
    - **Scalability:** Designed to seamlessly handle numbers that grow into millions, billions, trillions, and beyond, adapting to different scales as needed.

- **Performance Optimization:**
    - Optimized to minimize computational overhead, ensuring smooth updates and displays even in real-time applications. Implemented with careful consideration of memory usage to handle massive numbers without significant performance impact.

**Conclusion:**

This implementation effectively addresses the challenge of presenting large numbers in idle games by leveraging an intuitive abbreviation system, ensuring clarity, performance, and flexibility. This system can be adapted or extended to fit various game requirements, providing a robust solution for developers.
